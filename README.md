# MusicMLClassification

The data file for this project is included in the repo (zipped file that creates a ./Musicians subdirectory with Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven, and Bach subdirectories. There are additional subdirectories within each of these (other than in Chopin - with is a flat directory). The .mid (MIDI) files for each composer are layed out within the various directories.

The code for loading these .mid files sits the FinalTeamProject_Group_5.jpynb notebook file.
